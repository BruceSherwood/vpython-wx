Building vpython with from Visual Studio C++ 

	You may find Eclipse a useful development and CVS environment (eclipse.org)		
	
	VPython CVS
	    Check-out the vpython-core2 module from
		:pserver:anonymous@visualpython.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/visualpython

	PythonX.N
		Install Python X.N via the Windows Installer at http://www.python.org/download/.
		Make sure it is installed on the same drive as vpython-core2, in \PythonXN.
		
	Install these Python modules: numpy, FontTools, ttfquery.
	
	Copy into C:\PythonXN\Lib\site-packages the folders site-packages\vis and site-packages\visual
	and docs found in \YourCVS\vpython-core2
                
    Install Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, which includes the platform SDK (System Development Kit)
        from http://www.microsoft.com/Express/Download/#webInstall
        
    It is important to use the older 2008 version of Visual C++, because that's what built Python 2.7.
    However, see the following for how to try to use Visual C++ 2010 with Python 2.7:
    	http://nukeit.org/compile-python-2-7-packages-with-visual-studio-2010-express
	Also, make sure that in the Visual Studio 2010 project properties, Linker > Input,
	you specify "Ignore Specific Default Libraries" to /NODEFAULTLIB:MSVCRT.lib.
	To avoid the link error Error 1 error LNK1220: '/DELAYSIGN' requires '/KEYFILE' or '/KEYCONTAINER'
	you need to go to Visual Studio project properties, Linker > Advanced, and clear Delay Sign.

    Unzip Boost
        Extract the files in vpython-core2/dependencies/win_boost.zip so that 
        there is a folder vpython-core2/dependencies/boost_files containing 
        boost (include files) and win_libs folders.
        
        These files were obtained from http://www.boostpro.com/download
        (If these files are not up to date with the current Python, you may have to
        build the Boost libraries from source. See below. This was the case in 
        Aug. 2010 when the standard release of Python was 2.7, but the boostpro 
        libraries had been built for Python 2.6.)
        
	On Vista, in Command Prompt, link from Python site-packages to the CVS files
	(YourCVS is the directory where you have put the CVS files)
        cd C:\Python2N\Lib\site-packages
		mklink /D visual \YourCVS\vpython-core2\site-packages\visual
	
	If you are using XP, you will need to copy/update these files 
		from CVS to C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages:
			visual, examples, docs

	Build cvisual.pyd
        Open the cvisual.sln project file in Visual Studio Express, make Release the active 
        configuration, then press F7.

        The .pyd file is placed in vpython-core2\site-packages\vis
        Copy this file to C:\PythonXN\Lib\site-packages\vis

        This is the only step that needs to be repeated as you make changes to the C++ source code.
        
    Get Polygon module.
    In setup.py I tried setting withNumPy=True and defaultStyle='STYLE_NUMPY', but it won't compile.
    In the Polygon directory execute C:\Python2N\python setup.py install
    
    Process MakeVPython.iss with Innosetup (innosetup.org) to build an installer:
    1) Run compilevisual.py from the Visual source package to
	   Python-compile all the Visual .py files (produces .pyc files).
	2) Make sure that C:\Python2N\Lib\idlelib\config-main.def has edit startup and 
	autosave set to 1 and that help is set for Visual before building the package.
	3) Double-click MakeVPython.iss. 
	4) Near the start of the file, update AppVerName if necessary.
	5) Do Build > Compile to produce a Windows installer.
	6) Run the installer.
	This produces a Windows installer that can be used by an administrator to
	install a fully-compiled Visual into a protected area that users can't write
	to. Without this second inno setup to get the .pyc files, every user would
	have to recompile some of the site-packages/visual/*.py files. No big deal,
	but nicer to have these files already compiled.

DEBUGGING
Go to the "System" control panel and choose advanced settings, then environment variables
Create a user variable "VPYTHON_DEBUG" and give it the value 1.

Run the Windows command prompt, found in Accessories in the program listings, cd to a
directory with a Python script, and execute this:

\Python2N\python.exe sometest.py

You'll get a trace of the VPYTHON_NOTE entries in the source code.

BUILDING BOOST FROM SOURCE
Download latest Boost (boost_1_43_0.zip, for example) from www.boost.org.
Unzip into boost_1_43_0, for example.

The following must be done from a Windows typescript, 
or the Visual Studio Command Prompt, NOT from Msys.
> cd boost_1_43_0

cd to the Boost directory and execute 

.\bootstrap.bat

to create the bjam tool and project-config.jam.

In the file project-config.jam, add the Python version (such as 3.1) for which the Boost
libaries are to be built:

using python : 3.1 ;

To build the Boost libraries, execute this for Python 2.x

.\bjam --build-type=complete --with-python --with-thread --with-signals stage

or this for Python 3.x

.\bjam --build-type=complete --with-python --with-thread --with-signals --with-random stage

"complete" means "make various variants of the libraries".

The files you want will be in stage/lib.
Move the following multithreaded static libraries to dependencies/boost_files/win_libs.

For Python 2.x:
libboost_python-vc90-mt-s-1_43.lib
libboost_signals-vc90-mt-s-1_43.lib
libboost_thread-vc90-mt-s-1_43.lib

For Python 3.x:
libboost_python3-vc90-mt-s-1_43.lib (and then change the name in win_libs to libboost_python-vc90-mt-s-1_43.lib)
libboost_signals-vc90-mt-s-1_43.lib
libboost_thread-vc90-mt-s-1_43.lib

Also, you need to copy the directory named boost from the Boost files into dependencies\boost_file.

For Boost 1_42_0, in line 21 of boost\python\exception_translator.hpp you maay need
to change bind to boost::bind. 

Problem bulding with Boost 1.37; found this on the web (this problem disappeared for Boost 1.42):
Furthermore building pyrap with boost-1.37 and gcc-4.3.2 gave an error 
due to a missing include. The following patch has to be applied to boost:
