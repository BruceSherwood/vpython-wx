HOW TO BUILD VISUAL 6 USING wxPython

If you're running OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

Install XcodeTools from the optional materials on the Mac installation DVD.
Installing XcodeTools automatically installs the large number of individualvp
components also listed on the DVD.

If you're running OSX 10.7 or 10.8 (Lion, or Mountain Lion)

Get XCode from the Mac App store (free).

(If you want to build for Enthought, or python.org's python3.2 you need
to get XCode 3.2 from the apple developer website.)

SDK setup
-----------------------------------
To build enthought or python3.2 versions you'll also need to make a link called
'Developer' from the root of your filesystem to wherever you've installed XCode. 
On my system that's:

ln -s /Developer-3.2.5 /Developer

This is because python.org python3.2 and enthought python2.7 both have -isysroot arguments
on all their generated compiler command line strings. This flag tells gcc where to
go to find SDKs, headers, etc.. 

If you do this, you'll also want to add "/Developer/usr/bin" to your path so that
you get the right version of gcc for your python build.

If you're building for python.org's python2.7 you can use a more modern version
of Xcode (e.g., 4.6) and no link is required, and no path change is needed.
(We'll see what happens when they release Xcode 5!)

Getting Python
-----------------------------------
Install Python for the Mac ("MacPython") from python.org, or the enthought
distribution if you want to build that version.

There is already a /usr/bin/python that at the moment is up to date, but
because this isn't always the case, and because the Python community seems to
strongly prefer it, we will base Visual on MacPython, which is /usr/local/bin/python.

Install wxPython, preferably the Cocoa version.

PYTHON INSTALLERS

The standard Python installers at python.org for the Mac install into
   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/

For Python 2.x, the installer modified .profile to add the newly installed Python
to the application search PATH. The installer also added or changed a link
   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current
to point to the newly installed Python.

It will probably happen automatically but you should check:

$which python

to see that the correct python is being invoked from the command line. If not,
update your PATH environment variable (in .profile or equivalent) to make it so.

If you have several versions of python installed (yes... that would be me). You'll
want to make sure 'Current' is set correctly for whichever version of python
you're building against. I've found this script useful:

--------------------
#!/bin/bash
#
# switchVersion.sh
#

cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions

rm Current

ln -s ./$1 Current

ls -l Current

echo "Now at version $1"
-------------------

If you set this script to be executable you can just say:

./switchVersion.sh 2.7

and it will switch the "Current" pointer to version 2.7

Always do this before you build any of the dependencies or visual python itself.

INSTALLING MODULES NEEDED BY VISUAL

You can get a numpy installer at http://www.numpy.org, or you can build from source.
Enthought, naturally, comes with numpy already. ;-)

setup.py will attempt to resolve other requirements at
https://pypi.python.org/pypi, but in case it's not successful you may
need to build from source ttfquery, polygon and fonttools.

Be sure to get ttfquery 1.0.4 or later.
Polygon is available at http://polygon.origo.ethz.ch/download
Currently, use the Polygon 2.0.1 binary for Python 2.6, which works with Python 27;
For python 3, try https://bitbucket.org/jraedler/polygon3/downloads

the VPython distribution concerning Polygon:

BUILD VISUAL
You need Boost libraries for the Mac. See below for how to build the Boost libraries.

unpack the boost sources and cd into the boost_1.5.x directory.

Make sure "Current" is set, and for python3.2, or enthought, make sure 
that /Developer/usr/bin is on your path.

#
# For python 2.7, or enthought use this:

./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=gcc --with-python-version=2.7 --with-python-root=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current --with-python=python2.7 --with-libraries=python,signals

# build for python3.2 use this

./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=gcc --with-python-version=3.2 --with-python-root=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current --with-python=python3.2 --with-libraries=python,signals

Then for python.org python2.7 or python3.2 use this:

./b2 link=static threading=multi toolset=darwin cxxflags="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"

for enthought use this:

./b2 link=static threading=multi toolset=darwin cxxflags="-arch i386"

The result is in the 'stage' directory. I keep multiple versions of the stage directory
around to build various versions of visual, and make a link to the one I'm using now:

aluminum:boost_1_52_0 steve$ ls -lad stage*
lrwxr-xr-x  1 steve  steve   15 Mar  2 09:51 stage -> stage-enthought
drwxr-xr-x  3 steve  steve  102 Mar  1 09:38 stage-enthought
drwxr-xr-x  3 steve  steve  102 Mar  1 11:06 stage-python.org-2.7
drwxr-xr-x  3 steve  steve  102 Mar  1 11:17 stage-python.org-3.2

But if you are only worried about one version, you can just leave it named "stage"

Finally, in your vpython-wx folder, make a subdirectory named 'dependencies' and
a subdirectory to that named 'boost_files'. In there, add some links:

./dependencies//boost_files/boost -> ../../../boost_1_52_0/boost
./dependencies//boost_files/mac_libs -> ../../../boost_1_52_0/stage/lib

to match wherever you unpacked boost.

finally in the vpython-wx directory type:

sudo python setup.py install

You should end up with a working visual python installation!

Something goes wrong, check above to see if you missed a step (I know.. there
are a lot of them!)

CREATE INSTALLER

In src/mac/PackageMaker is an Apple PackageMaker project file, a Welcome text file
for creating a VPython installer for the Mac, and instructions in packaging.txt.
