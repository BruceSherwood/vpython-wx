          Displays</font></h1>
      <p class="Normal"> Initially, there is one VPython display named <span class="attribute">scene</span>. 
        Display objects do not create windows on the screen unless they are used, so 
        if you immediately create your own display object early in your program you 
        will not need to worry about scene. If you simply begin creating objects such 
        as sphere they will go into scene.</p>
        <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">display()</span> Creates a display 
          with the specified attributes, makes it the selected display, and returns 
          it. For example, the following creates another VPython display  600 by 
          200, with its upper left corner at the upper left corner of the screen (y is measured down from the top of the screen), with 'Examples of Tetrahedrons' in the title bar, centered on location (5,0,0), and with 
          a background color of cyan filling the window.</p>

            <p class="program"> scene2 = display(title='<span class="attributes">Examples of Tetrahedrons</span>',<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x=0, y=0, width=600, height=200,<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;center=(5,0,0), background=(0,1,1))</p>
            <p class="Normal"><strong> <font color="#0000A0">Exiting a VPython program</font></strong></p>
            <p class="Normal"> By default, one exits from a VPython program by clicking the close box on a display window (and  the <span class="attribute"><a href="#exit"><strong>exit</strong></a></span> option described below lets you specify whether all windows close or just the display window that was clicked). You can also exit a VPython program under program control:</p>
            <p class="program">exit() </p>
          <p class="Normal"><strong> <font color="#0000A0">General-purpose options</font></strong></p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">select()</span> Makes the specified 
            display the &quot;selected display&quot;, so that objects will be drawn 
            into this display by default; e.g. <span class="attribute">scene.select() </span></p>
 
            <p class="Normal">Executing <span class="attribute">myscene = </span><font color="#FF0000">display.get_selected()</font> returns
               a reference to the display in which objects are currently being
               created.</p>

          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">foreground</span> Set color 
            to be used by default in creating new objects such as sphere; default is 
            white. Example: <span class="attribute">scene.foreground = (1,0,0)</span> </p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">background</span> Set color 
            to be used to fill the display window; default is black.</p>
          <p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">ambient</span> Color
            of nondirectional  (&quot;ambient&quot;) lighting. Default is color.gray(0.2);
            for compatibility with earlier versions of VPython, this can 
            be expressed as scene.ambient=0.2. </p>
      <p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">lights</span> List of light
            objects created for this display. By default, scene.lights is this list:<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="attribute">[distant_light(direction=(0.22, 0.44, 0.88), color=color.gray(0.8))</span>,<br /> 
            <span class="attribute">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distant_light(direction=(-0.88, -0.22, -0.44),
              color=color.gray(0.3))]</span><br />
            These are equivalent to the default lights in VPython prior to version
            5. For how to create your own distant and local lights, see <a href="lights.html">Lighting</a>. <br />
      </p>
          <p class="attributes"><span class="attribute"><font color="#000000">To obtain </font>camera position</span>, see <a href="mouse.html">Mouse Interactions</a>.</p>
          <p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">cursor.visible</span> By
            setting <span class="attribute">scene.cursor.visible = False</span>,
            the mouse cursor  becomes invisible. This is often appropriate while
            dragging an object using  the mouse. Restore the cursor with <span class="attribute">scene.cursor.visible
            = True</span>.  If <span class="attribute">scene</span> is part of a wxPython window that includes other elements such as buttons, and you want to hide the cursor everywhere in a window<span class="Normal"> named </span><span class="attribute">w</span><span class="Normal">, use </span><span class="attribute">w.cursor.visible = False</span> (this does not currently work on a Macintosh).</p>
      <p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">objects</span> A list
            of all the visible objects in the display; invisible objects and
            lights are not listed (<span class="attribute">scene.lights</span> is a list of existing lights).
            For example, the following makes all visible boxes in the scene red: </p>
<p class="program">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for obj in scene2.objects: <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if isinstance(obj, box):<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.color = color.red</p>
<p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">window</span> You can create a wxPython window with <strong><span class="Normal">w = window(....)</span></strong> and place various <strong><a href="controls.html">widgets</a></strong> in it such as buttons and sliders, and VPython 3D graphics displays or graphs, like this:<strong>d = display(window=w, ....) </strong>or <strong>g = gdisplay(window=w, ....)</strong>. You have to specify a wxPython window when you create the VPython display or gdisplay; you can't create a display and then later choose to assign <strong>d.window = w</strong>. The <a href="controls.html"><strong><a href="controls.html">widgets</a></strong></a> description includes details on the attributes of a wxPython window object.</p>
<p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">delete</span> You can delete a display named <strong>d</strong> with <strong>d.delete()</strong> without stopping your program, then create a new display. The delete function deletes all the objects and lights before deleting the display itself. If the display is inside a wxPython window, the window and other widgets in the window remain. You can delete an entire wxPython window named <strong>w</strong> with all its widgets with <strong>w.delete()</strong>. You can delete all windows and displays with <strong>window.delete_all().</strong> Note that it is <strong>window.delete_all()</strong>, not <strong>w.delete_all()</strong>, because the operation affects all windows, not one particular window.</p>
<p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">stereo</span> Stereoscopic
            option; <span class="attribute">scene.stereo = 'redcyan'</span> will
            generate a scene for the left eye and a scene for the right eye,
            to be viewed with red-cyan glasses, with the red lens over the left
            eye. (There are also <span class="attribute">'redblue'</span> and <span class="attribute">'yellowblue'</span> options;
            note that objects that were not originally white may be somewhat
        dim.) <br />
            <br />
Setting <span class="attribute">scene.stereo = 'crosseyed'</span> produces side-by-side
images which if small enough can be seen in 3D by crossing your eyes but focusing
on the screen (this takes some practice). Setting <span class="attribute">scene.stereo
= 'passive'</span> produces side-by-side images which if small enough can be
seen in 3D by looking &quot;wall-eyed&quot;, looking into the far distance but
focusing on the screen (this too takes some practice), or by using inexpensive stereoscopic viewers. <span class="attribute"><br />
            <br />
scene.stereo = 'active'</span> will render alternating left eye/right eye images
for viewing through shutter glasses if the graphics system supports quad buffered
stereo. If stereo equipment is not available, setting the option has no effect.
You can also use <span class="attribute">scene.stereo = 'passive'</span> with
quad buffered stereo for display using two polarized projectors (for stereo viewing
using simple passive polarized glasses). Quad buffered 'active' stereo is only
available on specialised graphics systems that have the necessary hardware and
shutter glass connector, such as 120 Hz displays and NVIDIA Quadro graphics
cards. It generates the illusion of depth by rendering each frame twice from
slightly different viewpoints corresponding to the left and right eyes. Special
shutter glasses are synchronised with the alternating images so that each eye
sees only the matching frame, and your brain does the rest. It's called 'quad
buffered' because there is an OpenGL buffer per eye, both double-buffered for
smooth updating.</p>
          <p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">stereodepth</span> By default, 
            the front of the scene is located at the location of the physical screen, 
            which reduces eye strain. Setting <span class="attribute">scene.stereodepth 
              = 1</span> moves the center of the scene to the location of the physical 
            screen, with the front half of the scene seeming to stick dramatically out 
            of the screen. <span class="attribute">scene.stereodepth = 2</span> moves 
            the scene fully in front of the physical screen, for maximally dramatic 
            stereo effect.</p>

      <p class="Normal">At times you may need to know how large is the display region inside a window: <strong>window.dwidth</strong>and <strong>window.dheight</strong> are the extra width and height of windows compared to the display region.       </p>
  <p class="Normal"><strong><font color="#0000A0">Controlling the view</font></strong>  </p>
  <p class="Normal">It is useful to run the  VPython example program <strong>camera.py</strong>, which illustrates how the following display options affect the view the user sees.  </p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">center</span> Location at which 
            
            the camera continually looks, even as the user rotates the position of the 
            
            camera. If you change <span class="attribute">center</span>, the camera 
            
            moves to continue to look in the same &quot;compass&quot; direction toward 
            
            the new center, unless you also change <span class="attribute">forward</span> (see next attribute). Default (0,0,0).</p>
          <p class="attributes"><span class="attribute">autocenter</span> scene.center 
            
            is continuously updated to be the center of the smallest axis-aligned box 
            
            containing the scene. This means that if your program moves the entire scene, 
            
            the center of that scene will continue to be centered in the window.</p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">forward</span> Vector pointing 
            
            in the same direction as the camera looks (that is, from the current camera 
            
            location, given by scene.mouse.camera, toward scene.center). The user rotation 
            
            controls, when active, will change this vector continuously. When <span class="attribute">forward</span> is changed, the camera position changes to continue looking at <span class="attribute">center</span>. 
            
            Default (0,0,-1).</p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">fov</span> Field of view of 
            
            the camera in radians. This is defined as the maximum of the horizontal 
            
            and vertical fields of view. You can think of it as the angular size of 
            
            an object of size range, or as the angular size of the longer axis of the 
            
            window as seen by the user. Default pi/3.0 radians (60 degrees).</p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">range</span> The extent
            of  
            the region of interest to the left or right of <span class="attribute">center</span>. This is the inverse of scale, so use either <span class="attribute">range</span> or <span class="attribute">scale</span> depending
            on which makes the most
            sense in your program. Setting range to 10 is the same as setting
            it to (10,10,10). Setting range to (10,10,10) means that scene.center+scene.range
            will be at the right edge of a square window. A sphere of radius
            10 will fill the window. A cubical box whose half-width is 10 will
            overfill the window, because the front of the box in 3D appears larger
            than the xy plane passing through scene.center, unless the field
        of view is very small.</p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">scale</span> A scaling
            factor  
            which scales the region of interest into the sphere with unit radius.
            This  
            is the inverse of range, so use either <span class="attribute">range</span> or <span class="attribute">scale</span> depending
            on which makes the most
            sense in your program. Setting scale to 0.1 is the same as setting
            it to (0.1,0.1,0.1) or setting range to (10,10,10).</p>
          <p class="attributes"> &nbsp;<span class="attribute">up</span> A vector representing 
            
            world-space up. This vector will always project to a vertical line on the 
            
            screen (think of the camera as having a &quot;plumb bob&quot; that keeps 
            
            the top of the screen oriented toward up). The camera also rotates around 
            
            this axis when the user rotates &quot;horizontally&quot;. By default the 
            
            y axis is the <span class="attribute">up</span> vector.</p>
          <p class="attributes"> There is an interaction between <span class="attribute">up</span> and <span class="attribute">forward</span>, the direction that the camera 
            
            is pointing. By default, the camera points in the -z direction (0,0,-1). 
            
            In this case, you can make the x or y axes (or anything between) be the <span class="attribute">up</span> vector, but you cannot make the z axis 
            
            be the <span class="attribute">up</span> vector, because this is the axis 
            
            about which the camera rotates when you set the <span class="attribute">up</span> attribute. If you want the z axis to point up, first set <span class="attribute">forward</span> to something other than the -z axis, for example (1,0,0).</p>
          <p class="attributes"> <span class="attribute">autoscale = False</span> no automatic 
            
            scaling (set range or scale explicitly);<span class="attribute">&nbsp;autoscale 
              
              = True</span> automatic scaling (default). It is often useful to let VPython 
            
            make an initial display with autoscaling, then turn autoscaling off to prevent 
            
            further automated changes.</p>
